# Advantages and Disadvantages of Relational Databases (RDBMS) vs NoSQL Databases

---

## Relational Databases (RDBMS)
Examples: MySQL	 PostgreSQL	 Oracle	 SQL Server

Relational databases store data in structured tables with predefined schemas and relationships enforced by primary and foreign keys.

---

### Advantages

1. Data Integrity (ACID Compliance)  
   - Ensures Atomicity	 Consistency	 Isolation	 and Durability	 ideal for financial and enterprise systems.

2. Structured and Consistent Schema  
   - Predefined schemas maintain consistency and logical organization for data accuracy.

3. Powerful & Standardized Querying (SQL)  
   - SQL allows complex joins	 aggregations	 and analytics.

4. Mature Ecosystem and Stability  
   - Extensive community and vendor support with decades of refinement.

5. Data Relationships & Referential Integrity  
   - Best suited for applications requiring strong entity relationships such as products	 customers	 and orders.

---

### Disadvantages

1. Limited Scalability (Vertical Scaling)  
   - Scales up rather than out	 potentially becoming costly for large systems.

2. Rigid Schema  
   - Schema changes can require migrations and potential downtime.

3. Performance Bottlenecks with Big Data  
   - Large datasets or many joins may reduce performance.

4. Less Efficient for Unstructured Data  
   - Not ideal for JSON	 multimedia	 or semi-structured data.

---

## NoSQL Databases
Examples: MongoDB	 Cassandra	 Redis	 DynamoDB	 Couchbase	 Neo4j

NoSQL databases provide flexibility	 scalability	 and performance for structured	 semi-structured	 and unstructured data by avoiding rigid schemas.

---

### Advantages

1. Flexibility (Schema-less Design)  
   - Data stored without formal structure	 allowing easy adaptations as applications evolve.

2. Horizontal Scalability (Scale-Out)  
   - Supports distributed systems that scale across multiple servers.

3. High Performance and Low Latency  
   - Optimized for fast reads/writes in large-scale or real-time applications.

4. Variety of Data Models  
   - Supports multiple models: Document	 Key-Value	 Column-family	 and Graph.

5. High Availability and Fault Tolerance  
   - Built-in replication and sharding ensure uptime and resilience.

---

### Disadvantages

1. Eventual Consistency (Not Always ACID)  
   - Often follow the BASE model	 leading to potential temporary inconsistencies.

2. Lack of Standardization  
   - Each system has unique query languages and interfaces.

3. Limited Complex Transactions  
   - Multi-document transactions are less reliable than in RDBMS.

4. Less Mature Ecosystem  
   - Rapidly evolving tools with less standardization than traditional RDBMS environments.

## When to Use Each

### Choose RDBMS If:
- Transactional accuracy is required.
- Data is highly structured with clear relationships.
- Complex joins and consistency are essential.

### Choose NoSQL If:
- Managing large	 evolving datasets across distributed systems.
- Prioritizing speed	 scalability	 or availability over strict consistency.
- Working with unstructured data like user-generated content.
