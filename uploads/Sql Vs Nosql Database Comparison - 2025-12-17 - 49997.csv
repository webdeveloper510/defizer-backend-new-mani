"Here's a table comparing the advantages and disadvantages of relational databases (SQL) versus NoSQL databases in terms of structure, scalability, and typical use cases:"

| Aspect           | Relational Databases (SQL)                                          | NoSQL Databases                                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structure        | Advantages                                                          | Advantages                                                 |
"|                      | - Provides a structured schema, ensuring data consistency.              | - Offers flexible, schema-less data models for diverse data types.  |"
"|                      | - Supports complex queries and relationships (joins).                   | - Handles various data formats: document, key-value, graph, etc. |"
|                      | Disadvantages                                                       | Disadvantages                                              |
"|                      | - Inflexible due to rigid schema, making adaptation difficult.          | - Often trades consistency for flexibility, potentially leading to eventual consistency issues.  |"
| Scalability      | Advantages                                                          | Advantages                                                 |
"|                      | - Vertical scalability is efficient for small to medium-sized data needs. | - Designed for horizontal scalability, suitable for handling large-scale data. |"
|                      | Disadvantages                                                       | Disadvantages                                              |
|                      | - Limited horizontal scalability can lead to performance bottlenecks.   | - Managing distributed systems can be complex and may impact consistency assurance. |
| Typical Use Cases| Advantages                                                          | Advantages                                                 |
"|                      | - Well-suited for applications requiring ACID compliance and strong data integrity, such as financial platforms. | - Ideal for real-time analytics, big data, and rapidly changing application environments. |"
|                      | - Excellent for transactional applications with complex data relationships.  | - Perfect for applications where speed and flexible data accommodations are crucial. |
|                      | Disadvantages                                                       | Disadvantages                                              |
"|                      | - Not optimal for unstructured or rapidly evolving data requirements.   | - Less suited for systems where immediate consistency is critical, such as traditional transaction-heavy applications. |"
