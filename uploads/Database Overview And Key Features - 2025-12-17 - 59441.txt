### Database Overview

A database is a systematically structured set of data held in a computer
or server, which is accessible in various ways. It is a core component
of information technology frameworks and supports the storage and
retrieval of a vast range of information.

#### Key Features of Databases

1.  Data Organization: Systematic structuring of data into tables or
    collections to facilitate efficient storage and access.
2.  Transaction Management: Ensures reliable completion of transactions
    using ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) standards
    to uphold data integrity.
3.  Security: Implements mechanisms such as authentication,
    authorization, and encryption to protect data from unauthorized
    access.
4.  Concurrency: Allows multiple users to access data simultaneously
    without resulting in conflicts, ensuring data integrity.
5.  Scalability: Supports growth in data volume and concurrent user
    access through scalable design, whether vertically or horizontally.
6.  Backup and Recovery: Provides tools and processes for data
    restoration following incidents such as loss or corruption.

### Comparison of Relational Databases vs. NoSQL Databases

Here is a table highlighting the primary differences between relational
and NoSQL databases:

#### Relational Databases vs. NoSQL Databases

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Feature/Aspect   Relational Databases       NoSQL Databases
  ---------------- -------------------------- -----------------------------
  Data Model       Structured tables with     Flexible schemas (document,
                   predefined schemas         key-value, graph, columnar)

  Scalability      Primarily vertical scaling Horizontal scaling designed
                                              for distributed systems

  Query Language   SQL (Structured Query      Various query languages
                   Language)                  specific to each NoSQL type

  Transactions     Strong ACID transaction    BASE properties (Basically
  Support          compliance                 Available, Soft state,
                                              Eventually consistent)

  Performance      Optimized for complex      High performance with large

                                              data

  Schema           Rigid and predefined,      Highly flexible, suited for
  Flexibility      changes can be costly      dynamic data models

  Use Cases        Ideal for applications     Suitable for big data
                   with structured data and   applications, incremental
                   complex joins              data changes, and
                                              unstructured data sets

  Examples         MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle  MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase
