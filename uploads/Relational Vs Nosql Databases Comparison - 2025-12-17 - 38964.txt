Here is a detailed table comparison of the advantages and disadvantages
of relational databases (SQL) versus NoSQL databases:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aspect        Relational Databases (SQL)       NoSQL Databases
  ------------- -------------------------------- ----------------------------
  Structure     Advantages:                      Advantages:

                \- Provides a structured schema, \- Offers flexible,
                ensuring data consistency and    schema-less data models that
                integrity.                       can easily adapt to changes.

                \- Supports complex queries and  \- Capable of handling a
                relationships through joins.     variety of data formats,
                                                 including document,
                                                 key-value, and graph models.

                Disadvantages:                   Disadvantages:

                \- A rigid schema makes adapting \- Often compromises
                to new data structures           immediate consistency for
                challenging.                     flexibility and speed,
                                                 potentially leading to
                                                 eventual consistency issues.

  Scalability   Advantages:                      Advantages:

                \- Vertical scalability can be   \- Designed for horizontal
                achieved by enhancing server     scalability, making it
                capabilities.                    suitable for managing

                                                 environments.

                Disadvantages:                   Disadvantages:

                \- Limited horizontal            \- Managing distributed
                scalability can lead to          systems can be complex,
                performance bottlenecks.         which may impact performance
                                                 and consistency.

  Typical Use   Advantages:                      Advantages:
