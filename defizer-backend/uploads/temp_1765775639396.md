# Document Style Preference Confirmation

Sure — I can generate a downloadable **PDF** version of this explanation for you.  

Before I do, please confirm which style you prefer:  

1. **Plain Report Format** – simple black-and-white text, ideal for study/reference.  
2. **Presentation Style** – formatted with headings, tables, and light design suitable for slides or meetings.  
3. **Academic Paper Format** – professional layout with abstract, introduction, comparison, and conclusion sections.  
4. **Advanced Visual Summary** – includes infographics and visual comparison tables (best for executives or presentations).
