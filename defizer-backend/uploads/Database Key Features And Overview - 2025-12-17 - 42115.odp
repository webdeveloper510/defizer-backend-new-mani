<h3 id="database-overview">Database Overview</h3>
<p>A database is a systematically organized collection of data that is managed and manipulated using a Database Management System (DBMS). Databases are essential in processing data efficiently, enabling storage, retrieval, and management of data in various ways across different applications.</p>
<h4 id="key-features-of-databases">Key Features of Databases</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Data Organization:
<ul>
<li>Structures data into organized forms such as tables, which allows efficient access and retrieval.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transaction Management:
<ul>
<li>Ensures that all operations on the database adhere to ACID principles (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to maintain integrity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Security:
<ul>
<li>Implements robust security measures including authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect against data breaches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Concurrency Control:
<ul>
<li>Allows simultaneous data operations by multiple users while maintaining data consistency and integrity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Scalability:
<ul>
<li>Capable of handling increased data loads either by enhancing current hardware (vertical scaling) or by adding more servers (horizontal scaling).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Backup and Recovery:
<ul>
<li>Offers solutions for data restoration in the event of data loss or corruption, ensuring reliability and continuity.</li>
</ul></li>
